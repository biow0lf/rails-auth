# README

This is demo repo for new rails auth.

Based on [Alexandre Ruban](https://github.com/alexandreruban) [Cookie-based authentication with Rails](https://www.rubanonrails.com/2/cookie-based-authentication-with-rails).

With changes from me:

1. Factories instead fixtures. Read as: FactoryBot instead of Rails Fixtures.
2. Specs instead tests. Read as: RSpec instead Minitest.
